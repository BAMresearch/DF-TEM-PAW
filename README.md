This repository contains the necessary sources and scripts to conduct automated precipitate analysis as demonstrated in the published article:

**Title**: "Enhancing Reproducibility in Precipitate Analysis: A FAIR Approach with Automated Dark-Field Transmission Electron Microscope Image Processing"  
**Authors**: Ghezal Ahmad Jan Zia, Thomas Hanke, Birgit Skrotzki, Christoph VÃ¶lker & Bernd Bayerlein  
**Journal**: Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation  
**Year**: 2024  
**DOI**: [10.1007/s40192-023-00331-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-023-00331-5)

The workflow utilized in this analysis includes the use of Omero Server as an Image Host, a plugin to generate semantic data for all images, and Omero Regions of Interest. The results are presented as a knowledge graph using the [PMD Core Ontology (PMDco)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264127523010195).
